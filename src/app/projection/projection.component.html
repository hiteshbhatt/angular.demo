      Content projection is a powerful feature in Angular that allows you to
      pass content from a parent component to a child component. This enables
      you to create reusable components that can accept different content based
      on the context in which they are used.

      In this example, we will demonstrate how to use content projection by
      creating a simple article component that can display different content
      passed from its parent component.
